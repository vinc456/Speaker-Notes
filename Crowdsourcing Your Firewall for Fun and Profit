Firstly, Jeff will review how to install OpenWRT firmware on any
supported router, and how to recover from problems. Then he'll discuss
collecting and sharing suspicious IP addresses with other router owners
and websites such as firehol.org, to collectively develop and evaluate
the reputation of such IPs. This combination of multiple reports helps
to resolve the problem of false positives frequently experienced with
blacklists. Jeff prefers to use OpenWRT rather than PFSense, because of
its IPSet module which enables this capability.

Jeff Wilkins in a true hacker. His grasp of security issues is not only
comprehensive, but pro-active. He has investigated many security
problems and provided companies with analyses and suggestions to improve
their products. His honeypots have identified bot-nets around the world
and he works to disrupt their use for things like spam. Jeff is
currently one of two of VanLUG's co-webmasters.
