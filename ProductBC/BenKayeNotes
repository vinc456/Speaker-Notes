what is Product marketing
how should we be working together

role and function
product marketer - your company is doing it.
PM, marketing team.
if you're releasing product
positioning, messaging.

What does product marketing mean at your org?
seems to change/vary

Sirius decisions, deep understanding of customer and their needs.
Pragmatic Marketing.
they market products.

Difficulty explaining what product marketers do

executives don't know what they should be doing
do demand/content marketing
sales engg
step on toes and do other people's jobs.

North Star
Diagnose the disease as opposed to tackle symptoms

Alignment
1 Shared context. look at function they are doing. where the company has come from and where they are going
2 single source of truth. reliable, everyone has access to.
3 Internal language. words mean different things to different people. Personas.


misalignment
marketing and sales messages drift
overselling product
sales chase dollars instead of market
lack of trust among team members



value comes from alignment
not owned by anyone in the org
but maybe Product marketers should do this

Pre-build (market strategy)
1 What problem do you solve? start with the problem, not the solution
2 For whom?
3 Why should they buy from you? what makes you unique/magic/special
4 Why now? littered with people who went too early. pioneers get arrows in their back.

Post-build (go to market)
Market strategy
1. marketplace. understand what is going on
Customers. who they target. point of entry. loose broad way.
Competitors.


telling the same story. dev, product, marketing
more power when this happens]

alignment
go to market strategy doesn't sit by itself, isolated from market strategy

hiring you to do a job/solve a problem

go to market: marketing, sales, sales engg, support

third responsibility: Product Delivery
market strategy

need to be clear about who is doing what
pass to marketing

"don't find customers for your product, find products for your customers"
understand your marketing, what makes you unique

force press release before writing the code
avoid chasm
between market strategy:


not just a playbook
assets to help organisation execute
Product assets
